            This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this 
            in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my 
            dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, 
            and it is well received.

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
                <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
                <li>1 Â½ cups sour cream</li>
                <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti 
                pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over 
                medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; 
                top with Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the meat sauce, 
                remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. 
                Top with grated Parmesan cheese. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and 
                cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes. 
            </li>
        </ol>
